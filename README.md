# myFirestoreApp
My first Firebase Firestore App within Kotlin Android development.

To get started, put your own google-services.json from Firebase account into app folder.

Thanks to [Devslopes](https://www.udemy.com/devslopes-firestore-for-android/learn/v4/content) which provided such an amazing training session in order to learn more about Firebase and Kotlin.
